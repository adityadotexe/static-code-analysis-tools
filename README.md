Enhancing Software Development Efficiency: A Study of Static Code Analysis Tools Integrated with Version Control Systems

Efficiently maintaining the quality of code and minimizing faults are important in software development. This research
presents a comparison between some notable static code analysis tools like FindBugs, SpotBugs, and PMD while focusing on
how they can be integrated with version control systems such as Gitâ€™s pre-commit hooks. The study evaluates the performance,
accuracy, integration ease of use among other strengths and weaknesses displayed by various approaches adopted for different
static code analysis tools during this process. Besides, we provide detailed steps on integrating these analyzers into Git hooks
accompanied by suggested methods of streamlining it. The results indicate that automating the analysis of codes is essential for
preserving their quality as well as enhancing development workflow efficiency.
